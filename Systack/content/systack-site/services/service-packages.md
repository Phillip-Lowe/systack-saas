# Systack — Two-Tier AI Automation Service Packages

> **Not AI consulting. Specific, named automations that run your business.**

---

## PREMIUM TIER — Systack Private

### Tagline
**"100% Private AI Automation. Your Data Never Leaves Your Building."**

### Target Client Profile

- **Industries:** Law firms, medical clinics, dental practices, accounting offices, financial advisors, insurance agencies, government contractors
- **Pain point:** Handles sensitive client data (PHI, PII, financial records, legal docs). Cannot use ChatGPT, Claude, or any cloud AI. Compliance mandates (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI, attorney-client privilege) make cloud AI a non-starter.
- **Current reality:** Staff manually typing invoices, extracting data from PDFs, responding to routine emails, entering data across systems. Hours lost daily.
- **Ideal size:** 5–100 employees. Has volume to justify dedicated hardware.

### The Pitch
Your data never touches the internet. Every model, every document, every automation runs on a dedicated machine inside your office — behind your firewall. Zero exposure to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or any third-party AI provider. You get the automation. They get nothing.

### Infrastructure
- **Hardware:** Dedicated Mac Studio or Linux workstation with NVIDIA RTX 4090 (24 GB VRAM) — installed on-premises
- **Network:** Fully air-gapped or firewalled to your internal LAN. No outbound AI traffic. Ever.
- **Models:**
  - `llama3-70b-instruct` (4-bit quantized) — High-capability reasoning for document understanding, email drafting, data extraction
  - `command-r` or `command-r-plus` — Optimized for RAG, tool use, and multi-step workflows
  - `nomic-embed-text` — Private vector embeddings for document search
- **Management:** Systack handles all model updates, quantization tuning, and hardware maintenance remotely via secure Tailscale tunnel (outbound management only; AI data stays local)

### Included Automations

| Automation | What It Does | Notifications | File Storage |

### Why This Price?

- Enterprise-grade privacy isn't cheap. The hardware alone is $7K+.
- Competitors selling "private AI" charge $2,000–$5,000/month for managed deployments.
- This is a managed appliance, not SaaS. You own the box. We keep it running.

## STANDARD TIER — Systack Accelerate

### Tagline
**"High-Speed AI Automation. Managed Infrastructure. Scale on Demand."**

### Target Client Profile

- **Industries:** E-commerce stores, real estate agencies, marketing firms, property management, small law firms (non-litigation), insurance brokerages, dental offices (non-surgical), boutique accounting firms
- **Pain point:** Manual, repetitive tasks eating hours. Staff doing data entry instead of revenue work. Customer inquiries piling up. Need automation now, at a price that makes immediate sense.
- **Current reality:** Copy-pasting between systems. Manually responding to the same 20 questions. Hand-entering orders, listings, or invoices.
- **Ideal size:** 2–50 employees. Fast-moving, growth-oriented.

### The Pitch
Your automations run on secure cloud GPU instances behind an encrypted VPN tunnel. Sub-2-second inference on every task. Pay for what you use. No hardware to buy. No IT overhead. The same private models, cloud-hosted.

### Infrastructure
- **Compute:** Secure cloud GPU instances (RunPod / Lambda Labs) in US data centers
- **Network:** WireGuard VPN tunnel (Tailscale) — encrypted point-to-point. Your data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **Models:**
  - `llama3-8b-instruct` (full precision) — Sub-2s inference for high-volume tasks
  - `mistral-7b` or `mixtral-8x7b` — Efficient routing, classification, extraction
  - `nomic-embed-text` — Embedded search and retrieval
- **Scaling:** Auto-scaling GPU instances. Spikes in volume? Capacity adjusts automatically. No queueing. No waiting.
- **Management:** Fully managed by Systack. You never touch a server.

### Included Automations

## FAQ

### "Is this AI consulting?"
**No.** Systack does not sell "AI strategy," "AI readiness assessments," or "AI roadmaps." We sell **named, deployed automations** that process invoices, extract data, classify documents, and respond to customers. You get working systems, not slide decks.

### "What's the difference between this and ChatGPT/Claude?"
ChatGPT and Claude are cloud-hosted general-purpose chatbots. Your data goes to OpenAI or Anthropic's servers. Systack Private runs entirely on your hardware with zero external data transmission. Systack Accelerate runs on private cloud instances behind encrypted tunnels. Neither shares your data with foundation model companies. And neither is a chatbot — they're purpose-built automation pipelines.

### "Do I need technical staff to run this?"
No. Systack manages everything. For Private tier, we install the hardware, configure the network, and maintain the models remotely. For Accelerate, there's nothing on-site. You interact with outputs — reviewed emails, extracted data, classified documents — not with models or servers.

### "What if the hardware fails? (Private tier)"
Hardware is client-owned and under manufacturer warranty. Systack maintains a replacement parts pipeline with 48-hour turnaround. Critical clients can opt for redundant hardware (+$3,500 one-time).

### "Can I switch between tiers?"
Yes. Start with Accelerate, prove ROI, then move to Private when privacy requirements or volume justifies it. Setup fees are credited toward upgrade if done within 6 months.

### "What's the real difference between Private and Accelerate?"
**Accelerate** uses your Slack and Google accounts for convenience. **Private** replaces those with SMS and local storage so your data never touches Slack/Google servers. Both use the same local AI, same Stripe integration, same core automations.

### "Do you offer a 'cloud' tier with OpenAI?"
No. Every Systack tier uses **local AI models** (Ollama). We don't offer a cloud-AI option because that would expose your data to OpenAI/Anthropic. If you want cloud AI, Zapier + ChatGPT is a better fit.

### "What if I don't have Google Workspace or Slack?"
**Accelerate:** We help you create free Slack + Google accounts during onboarding.  
**Private:** You don't need them. We use SMS and local storage instead.

### "What automations are NOT included?"
We don't automate client-facing chat without human review. We don't automate legal advice, medical diagnosis, or financial recommendations. We don't build public-facing AI chatbots (different service). We don't train custom models from scratch.

### "What's an 'automation run'? (Accelerate tier)"
One automation run = one complete task execution (e.g., processing one invoice, classifying one document, drafting one email response). The 10K/mo tier covers most small businesses. We'll show your usage dashboard so there are no surprises.

### "How long until I see results?"
Private tier: 2–3 weeks from contract to live automations. Accelerate tier: 1 week. Most clients report time savings within the first month.

### "Do you work with my existing software?"
We integrate with common platforms: QuickBooks, Xero, Salesforce, HubSpot, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, and most CRMs/EHRs with APIs. Custom integrations available at additional cost.
